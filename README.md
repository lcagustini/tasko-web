# Tasko Web

*Web Front-end for a Tasko Server*   
This loads up JSON data from the server, displays it and tries to keep the UI up to date with the server.

This project uses [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) and tries to adhere to the Material Design Guidelines.   
No other external library has been used, yet.

It should be provided by default as the home of a Tasko Server.
